# Trueffel-Landing Page (German)
A Landing Page for a client collecting & selling truffles, where you also can contact him.

# Description
This is a personal Project for a potential, which was never fully released (to this point).

I tried to make a modern looking website using a personal selected Color-Palette. 
The Website contains two sections:
 - The first impression including a fullscreen background image, and a Hero Section.
 - The form where you can contact the Business

Furthermore, I included a fixed sidebar on the right side, with clickable links. As you can see there, I had some plans to take this website a little further, but it was good enough for my client. As this Website never went online (to date), I left it as it is, maybe I will come back in the future to finish this project, but it's not my top priority.

I learned a ton making this website, as I only knew the basics of HTML & CSS. A special part of this project was the design of the website. I informed myself about many topics in the webdesign-field, like colors, readability, accessibility and much more.
It was also important for me to include semantic HTML as much as I knew and I setup everything for a good SEO-Rating.

# Links & Wrap-Up
No links for this Project that needed to be addressed.

Lastly, thank you for reviewing my Code and/or my Application!
